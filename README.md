# Docker Manager Application

## Overview

The Docker Manager is a desktop application developed to facilitate Docker container management through a user-friendly graphical interface. By leveraging PyQt5 for the GUI and Docker's Python SDK for backend operations, the application provides a streamlined approach to handling Docker environments. This tool simplifies Docker management by abstracting complex command-line operations into a graphical interface, making it accessible to users of varying expertise.
Users can start, stop and pause running containers from the main window. The collumn on the left side of the screen allows users to see which containers are runnig or stopped. Below the containers there is a section for the existing images, this area is only informative.
Users can find two buttons on the bottom right, one for a help pop-up, and one for detailing existing images. [see below](#docker-image-detailer)


## How to use

### This application only works on linux systems!
- **install** [Dependencies](#Dependencies)
- **install** pip packages `pip install requirements.txt`
- **run** `python main.py`

-
- In a perfect world that is how it should work...
- 
- Install and enable docker!
# With arch based systems:
- sudo pacman -S python-pyyaml
- sudo pacman -S python-docker
- sudo pacman -S python-flask
- sudo pacman -S python-numpy
- sudo pacman -S python-pyqtgraph
- sudo pacman -S python-plotly
- Run as `sudo python main.py` 
# With debian base systems:
I believe same as with arch, only apt install instead of pacman -S. 

# Other distros:
I don't know. I use arch BTW.

Run as sudo otherwise it gives segmentation fault.

### Key Objectives

The application aims to:
- Provide an intuitive graphical interface for managing Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes.
- Enable real-time monitoring and management of Docker resources.
- Simplify deployment of multi-container applications using Docker Compose.
- Enhance user productivity by offering an easy-to-use alternative to command-line Docker management.


### Core Components

    - **List Containers**: Retrieves and returns a list of all Docker containers, including their IDs, names, statuses, and available actions.
    - **Start Container**: Starts a specified stopped container.
    - **Stop Container**: Stops a currently running container.
    - **Remove Container**: Deletes a specified container from the Docker engine.
    - **Inspect Container**: Provides detailed information about a specific container, including its configuration and status.

- **Image Operations**:
    - **List Images**: Lists all Docker images available locally with details.
    - **Pull Image**: Downloads an image from a Docker registry to the local machine.
    - **Push Image**: Uploads a local image to a Docker registry.
    - **Tag Image**: Assigns a new tag to an existing image.
    - **Remove Image**: Deletes a specified image from the local Docker repository.

- **Network Operations**:
    - **List Networks**: Retrieves a list of all Docker networks.
    - **Create Network**: Creates a new Docker network with specified parameters.
    - **Inspect Network**: Provides details about a particular network.
    - **Remove Network**: Deletes a specified Docker network.

- **Volume Operations**:
    - **List Volumes**: Displays a list of all Docker volumes.
    - **Create Volume**: Creates a new volume for Docker containers.
    - **Inspect Volume**: Provides detailed information about a specific volume.
    - **Remove Volume**: Deletes a specified Docker volume.
    - **Prune Volumes**: Removes unused volumes to free up disk space.

- **Error Handling**:
    - **Exception Management**: Handles and logs exceptions that occur during Docker API interactions.
    - **Logging**: Captures and stores error messages for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.

#### 2. ResourceMonitor

The `ResourceMonitor` class is responsible for monitoring and visualizing the resource usage of Docker containers. It collects and provides real-time data on CPU, memory, and disk usage.

- **Initialization**:
    - Sets up monitoring for the specified Docker containers.

- **Data Collection**:
    - **CPU Usage**: Retrieves and reports the CPU usage of monitored containers.
    - **Memory Usage**: Tracks and displays memory consumption.
    - **Disk Usage**: Monitors disk space usage for each container.

- **Visualization**:
    - **Real-Time Graphs**: Displays dynamic graphs representing the real-time resource usage of containers.


#### 3. GUI Components

The GUI components are implemented using PyQt5 and provide the user interface for interacting with Docker and managing Docker resources.

- **MainWindow**:
    - **Overview**: The primary application window that hosts the various interface panels and controls.
    - **Navigation**: Includes tabs or menus for accessing different management views (containers, images, networks, volumes).

- **ContainerView**:
    - **Listing**: Displays all Docker containers with detailed information.
    - **Operations**: Allows users to start, stop, remove, and inspect containers.
    - **Logs**: Provides access to real-time logs for selected containers.

- **ImageView**:
    - **Listing**: Shows a list of Docker images with relevant details.
